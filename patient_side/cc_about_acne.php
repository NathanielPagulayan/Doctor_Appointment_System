    <h2 class = "def1">There is no connection between acne and eczema. It might be challenging to tell them apart because of how similar 
        their symptoms can appear. Pimples appear because of acne. A bumpy, red, or discolored rash that resembles pimples is brought on 
        by eczema. The causes and treatments of eczema and acne vary.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Red papules and bumps called papules appear on the skin of some people with eczema. This condition is referred to as 
        papular dermatitis or papular eczema. The itching and skin infections that can result from papular eczema can be very uncomfortable.</h2>
