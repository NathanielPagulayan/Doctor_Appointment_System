    <h2 class = "def1">The diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illnesses are performed by pulmonologists. You may also hear these 
        medical professionals referred to as chest doctors, lung specialists, or lung doctors. Along with your lungs, your respiratory 
        system also consists of blood vessels, muscles, your nose, throat, trachea, and airways.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">The respiratory system is the focus of a pulmonologist's training. A pulmonologist is a doctor who wants to treat 
        any respiratory issue, from the windpipe to the lungs, so long as it has to do with the lungs or any other portion of the respiratory 
        system.</h2>
