    <h1 class = "aboutdef">DEFINITION</h1>
    <h2 class = "def1">The process of a female body containing and growing an embryo or fetus. Positive results on an over-the-counter 
        urine test can serve as a warning sign for this ailment, and a blood test, ultrasound, fetal heartbeat detection, or X-ray can 
        provide more evidence. Based on the date of the woman's last menstrual cycle, pregnancy lasts around nine months (LMP). Three 
        trimesters, each lasting around three months, are the traditional division.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">When you might feel unwell or be sick, pregnancy symptoms begin. Vomiting can occur at any hour of the day or night,
         despite the fact that it is frequently referred to as "morning sickness." Around 4 to 6 weeks into your pregnancy is when symptoms 
         typically start to appear.</h2>
