    <h2 class = "def1">Both the flu and the common cold are contagious respiratory infections, but they are brought on by distinct viruses. 
        In contrast to the common cold, which can be brought on by a variety of viruses such as rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal 
        coronaviruses, the flu is only brought on by influenza viruses.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">The common cold is an infection of the nose and throat caused by a virus called the common cold 
        (upper respiratory tract). It is typically harmless, but can occur more frequently in infants and young children. Influenza is 
        an infectious respiratory infection that affects the nose, throat, and occasionally the lungs, and can result in minor to 
        severe disease. The best approach to protect yourself from the flu is to get vaccinated every year.</h2>
