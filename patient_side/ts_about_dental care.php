    <h2 class = "def1">An expert in medicine who focuses on dentistry is a dentist, commonly referred to as a dental surgeon 
        (the diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the oral cavity and other aspects of the 
        craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint).</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Dental hygiene, the practice of keeping the mouth and teeth clean to prevent dental problems, is a subset of 
        dental care, which is the maintenance of healthy teeth. Dental care is provided by a dentist, who also performs dental surgery 
        and maintains a professional oral hygiene regimen.
