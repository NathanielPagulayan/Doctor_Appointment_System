    <h2 class = "def1">When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, it can cause gout, a kind of arthritis that affects one or more 
        joints and causes sharp crystals to form. Gout can affect your elbow, hand, wrist, knee, ankle, foot, and big toe, though it most 
        frequently affects the big toe. Inflammatory arthritis is a frequent and excruciating condition known as gout. Normally, just one 
        joint is impacted at once. There are episodes of worsening symptoms, known as flares, and remissions, which are periods without 
        symptoms.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">It is believed that the immune system's flaw, which leads the body to attack its own tissues in the joints, is what 
        causes the majority of kinds of arthritis. This could be passed down through genetics. An immune system disorder or a metabolic 
        disorder like gout can lead to the development of other types of arthritis.</h2>
