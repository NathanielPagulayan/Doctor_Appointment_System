    <h2 class = "def1">Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects the body's metabolism and is defined by excessive blood glucose levels 
        (also known as blood sugar levels). Over time, this condition can cause major harm to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys,
         and nerves. Most diabetes kinds have an unknown specific cause. Sugar accumulates in the blood in every situation. Due to 
         inadequate insulin production by the pancreas, this occurs. It's possible for a mix of hereditary and environmental variables 
         to contribute to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Using blood tests, your doctor can determine whether you have diabetes, prediabetes, or gestational diabetes. 
        If your blood glucose level, commonly known as blood sugar, is greater than what is considered to be good for you, a blood test 
        will reveal this. The kind of diabetes you have can also be determined through blood tests.</h2>
