    <h2 class = "def1">Blood pressure that is higher than usual is referred to as high blood pressure or hypertension. Your daily activities 
        affect how your blood pressure changes. High blood pressure may be diagnosed if blood pressure readings are frequently above normal 
        (or hypertension). Early-morning headaches, nosebleeds, abnormal heartbeats, changes in eyesight, and ear buzzing are just a few of 
        the symptoms that can appear. Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors are all symptoms of 
        severe hypertension.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">In order to pump blood to the rest of the body, a person with high blood pressure makes their heart work harder. 
        It thickens the left ventricle, the lower left compartment of the heart. Heart attack, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death 
        risk all rise with a thickened left ventricle.</h2>
