    <h2 class = "def1">The area of medicine focuses on identifying, treating, and preventing illnesses of the genitalia, 
        oral cavity, hair, and nails. Cosmetic improvement and care are also occasionally necessary. The study of the skin 
        is what dermatology is all about.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Many dermatologists perform minor surgery, such as the removal of warts or moles, or take skin biopsies. 
        Some dermatologists will focus on more involved surgeries. The removal of skin cancer or benign cysts is one of these operations.</h2>
