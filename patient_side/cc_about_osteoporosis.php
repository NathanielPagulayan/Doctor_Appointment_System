    <h2 class = "def1">Bones that have osteoporosis are so fragile that they are readily broken. The reason it's referred to as a 
        "silent disease" is that those who develop it might not notice any changes until a bone fracture, which is typically a bone 
        in the hip, spine, or wrist. Living tissue makes up bones. Osteoporosis develops as a result of a lifelong deficiency in calcium. 
        Reduced bone density, early bone loss, and a higher risk of fractures are all effects of low calcium intake. disorders of eating. 
        Both men's and women's bones are weakened by severe food restriction and underweight status.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">You can slow down bone loss with a range of health and lifestyle changes, but osteoporosis cannot be fully reversed 
        and is not thought to be treatable. In order to promote bone growth and slow bone loss, your doctor might also recommend drugs.</h2>
