    <h2 class = "def1">When most people hear the term migraine, they often think of a severe headache. But headaches are only one symptom 
        of migraines, and they can range in severity and length. "Migraines are a neurological disease that involves nerve pathways and 
        chemicals," explains Brockman.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Headaches are a common condition that can vary in intensity, location, and frequency. A migraine is typically a
         moderate to severe headache that is felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Common symptoms include feeling unwell 
         and heightened sensitivity to light or sound.</h2>
