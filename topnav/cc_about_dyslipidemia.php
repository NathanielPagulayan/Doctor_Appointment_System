    <h2 class = "def1">Dyslipidemia, which is characterized by high levels of total or LDL cholesterol or low levels of HDL cholesterol, 
        is a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The excessive consumption of calories, saturated fat, 
        cholesterol, and trans fats from sedentary lifestyles combined with inherited (familial) disorders of lipid metabolism are among 
        the causes of dyslipidemia.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">Bile acid-binding resins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nicotinic acid, and derivatives of fibric acid are some of 
        the most often utilized choices for the pharmacologic therapy of dyslipidemia. Plasmapheresis, hormone replacement therapy, and 
        even surgery are further options in a few circumstances when other treatments have failed.</h2>
