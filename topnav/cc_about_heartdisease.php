    <h2 class = "def1">There are many different cardiac disorders that fall under the umbrella term "heart disease." Coronary artery 
        disease (CAD), which affects heart blood flow, is the most prevalent type of heart disease in the United States. Heart attacks 
        can be triggered by decreased blood flow. High blood pressure, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, diabetes, 
        exposure to secondhand smoke, obesity, a poor diet, and inactivity are the main risk factors for heart disease and stroke.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">The majority of heart attacks are characterized by discomfort in the middle or left side of the chest that last 
        for more than a few minutes or that fades and reappears. A pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain-like sensation can be experienced 
        as the discomfort.</h2>
